 INS_submarine_1:0 "K-III Class"
 INS_submarine_1_desc:0 "The K-III class consisted of two submarines built for and used by the Royal Dutch Navy as patrol subs. They were commissioned in the early 1920s, and based on the U.S. INS_land-class submarines. Each displaced over 580 tons and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes. "

 INS_submarine_2_desc:0 "The O16 submarine was manufactured and commissioned in the Netherlands for the Royal Dutch Navy in 1936. She was a large submarine, displacing over 980 tons. She had a diving depth of 80m and was armed with eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 INS_submarine_3:0 "O21 Class"
 INS_submarine_3_desc:0 "The O21 class consisted of seven submarines built and commissioned by the Netherlands. The ships were all incomplete at the time of the German invasion, though five managed to escape to Britain and serve the Dutch Navy in exile. The subs were slightly larger than the preceding O-class subs, displacing over 990 tons, but were similarly armed with eight 533mm torpedo tubes."
 INS_submarine_4:0 "Zwaardvis Class"

 INS_destroyer_1:0 "Van Ghent Class"
 INS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Van Ghent, or Admiralen, class consisted of eight destroyers built for the Royal Dutch Navy between 1926 and 1931. The ships were based upon early versions of the British A-class. All ships fought in World War II and were either scuttled or sunk. The ships displaced over 1,300 tons, were armed with four 120mm guns, and had decent speed for their vintage."
 INS_destroyer_3:0 "Callenburgh Class"
 INS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Gerard Callenburgh class planned for four destroyers for the Royal Dutch Navy. All four were launched before the German invasion, but only two were completed, one by the British after escaping to England, and one by the Germans. These destroyers displaced over 1,600 tons, were armed with five 120mm guns in their main armament, as well as eight 533mm torpedo tubes, and had good speed."
 INS_destroyer_4:0 "Piet Hein Class"
 INS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Piet Hein class consisted of three British S-class destroyers transferred to the Royal Dutch Navy shortly after the war. The ships displaced over 1,800 tons, were armed with four 120mm/45 QF Mk IX guns, and had a wide array of ASW armaments."
 INS_light_cruiser_1:0 "Java Class"
 INS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dutch commissioned two Java-class light cruisers in the mid-1920s. The ships were designed in Germany but constructed in the Netherlands. They displaced nearly 6,700 tons and had a main armament of ten 150mm Bofors guns. They were lightly armored and had decent speed for their vintage."
 INS_light_cruiser_2:0 "De Ruyter Class"
 INS_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The light cruiser De Ruyter was built and commissioned in the Netherlands during the mid-1930s. She served primarily in the Dutch East Indies. She displaced over 6,500 tons and was armed with seven 150mm guns in her main armament. She had below-average speed but good range."
 INS_light_cruiser_3:0 "Tromp Class"
 INS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Tromp class consisted of a pair of relatively small light cruisers commissioned for the Netherlands just before the German invasion. Both served in the Far East and survived the war. They displaced only 3,350 tons and, as designed, had six 150m guns as their main armament."
 INS_light_cruiser_4:0 "De Zeven Provinciën Class"
 INS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The De Zeven Provinciën class consisted of two cruisers laid down just before the German invasion but not completed until 1951. The final design was modified from the original 1939 plan, and led to two ships that displaced over 12,000 tons and were armed with eight Bofors 152mm cannon. They were well-armored for a light cruiser and had good range."
 INS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Soerabaja Class"
 INS_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dutch cruiser Soerabaja, originally named De Zeven Provinciën, was a coastal defense ship ('panterschip') built and commissioned in the Netherlands prior to World War I.

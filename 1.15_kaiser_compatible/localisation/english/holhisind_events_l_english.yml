 holhis_history.1.t:0 "Overview of the Dutch East Indies"
 holhis_history.1.desc:0 "The Indonesian Archipelago, at this time known as the Malay Archipelago, or beforehand, the Spice Archipelago, is a collection of 17.5 thousand islands spanning 6.400 kilometers from the island of Sabang on the western tip to the Dutch portion of the island of New Guinea on the easternmost. Few governments managed to rule over the archipelago, with some exceptions such as Srivijaya, Majapahit, and now, the Dutch East Indies.\n \nCurrently, the East Indies is still reeling from the aftereffects of the Great Depression, known here as The Malaise, as the colony shared three-fifths of the whole Kingdom of the Netherlands' imperial costs. Furthermore, for the last five years the colony is governed under Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge, a staunch conservative who seek to limit the pace of both economic and political reforms to benefit the local Bumiputras as little as possible in effort to prevent another disorder such as the failed communist uprising in 1927.\n \nImportant Indonesian nationalists leaders such as Soekarno, Hatta, and Sjahrir were exiled on the Great East, and the communist leadership are either exiled abroad or in hiding. A few challengers to his rule persists, though, such as the leader of Nationalist Faction in the Volksraad, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin, and also former leader of the liberal De Stuw (Forward) Movement, Hubertus Johannes van Mook, which currently working as chief advisor at Departement of Economic Affairs.\n \nThe military, both ground and naval forces are rather underequipped and undertrained compared to the usual standards, and there is no airforce to be relied on too. The East Indies must surmount those burdens to survive and successfully modernize in the 20th Century."

 holhis_history.2.t:0 "History of the Dutch East Indies"
 holhis_history.2.desc:0 "The Indonesian Archipelago until 1920 was never ruled entirely by a single polity, rather, it was governed by hundreds of local polities, their effectiveness limited by local technologies to traverse the seas, jungles, and mountains to maintain their trade posts throughout the important sea lanes and governance in the overseas and interior lands.\n \nA few polities, however, managed to do exactly just that, with the earliest known polity (discovered in 1913, although only limited in scholarly circles) was the Sumatran kingdom of Srivijaya which directly ruled Southern Sumatra and indirectly ruled the rest of Sumatra, Western Java, western part of Borneo, and Malayan Peninsula from 7th to 14th Century.\n \nThe second one that came later, but managed to live in the memory of the local populace through preservation of their literatures and Anglo-Dutch archaeological discoveries in early 18th century, was the famous Javanese Empire of Majapahit which held indirect rule on every major island in the East Indies (as far as Bird's Head Peninsula in the east) and also Malaya, with the only land they ruled directly was on Eastern Java.\n \nThe later polities that came after them would never attain territories outside of their own island, and were indigenous until the arrival of the Portuguese on Sunda Kingdom in 1522, marking the first arrival of the Europeans in the Nusantaran Archipelago. Although the Portuguese failed to protect Sunda from the Sultanate of Demak, they managed to establish trading posts on Ternate Island in the Moluccas. Despite fightings with the Spanish Empire, the Portuguese prevailed after the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529 assigned the Moluccas to the Portuguese hands, in exchange of the Phillipines remained on the Spanish claim. The Portuguese managed to establish a monopoly on spice trade with the help of local rulers such as the Sultante of Ternate, but after the Dutch arrival, they were eventually driven into the eastern portion of Timor Island and Macau as the last vestiges of the Portuguese Empire in the East and Southeast Asia."

 holhis_history.3.t:0 "The Most Successful Corporation in History"
 holhis_history.3.desc:0 "In 1596, the First Dutch Expedition to the East Indies, led by Cornelis de Houtman, arrived in Banten, West Java, in attempt to bypass the Portuguese control of the spice trade. Although the expedition almost ended in failure, the expedition proved successful, both politically and economically (barely). Thus, two Dutch companies joined forces to fund the second, much more successful expedition to the Indies in 1598, with the resultant profits paid off the expedition four times over. On another expedition backed by another company, Cornelis de Houtman was killed in a naval battle against the Sultanate of Atjeh in 1599.\n \nMotivated with such lucrative prospects, dozens of expedition companies was formed in the Netherlands in attempts to profit off the spice trade, and also to wrestle the Portuguese monopoly on it. In attempt to better coordinate the trading companies, the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (United East India Company) was established in 1602. Starting in 1603, the first Dutch trading post was established in Banten with the help of the Sultanate of Banten who sought protection from the Portuguese Empire, with a second post was established on Amboina, in the Moluccas, later in the decade.\n \nThroughout the two centuries of company rule in the East Indies, VOC was granted special priviledges under the blessings of the Dutch government and were allowed to raise their own armies and fleets, print their own currencies, enforcing monopoly on spice trade, and other governmental powers including diplomacy and colonial establishments, bringing immense amount of wealth for their investors. The Dutch expanded their control over the archipelago with both direct rule (such as the city of Batavia and its surroundings and the islands of Seram and Banda) and indirect rule (such as Mataram vassalage in Central Java).\n \nBut marred with corruption and later, conflict on both the archipelago and also funding the Dutch wars against her enemies, VOC declared bankruptcy in 1800, with its assets was taken over by the Dutch Republic, a client state under the Napoleonic French Empire. The French reorganization of the Batavian Republic into the Kingdom of Holland brought changes to in the Indies, with a Dutch Patriot, Herman Willem Daendels, was appointed as the 36th Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies with important task to defend the archipelago from an upcoming British attacks."

 holhis_history.4.t:0 "Dutch Expansion Begins"
 holhis_history.4.d:0 "Daendels managed to strengthen the fortifications in Java and introduces Napoleonic Code as the legal system in the Indies. Despite of that, the British managed to conquer the Spice Islands in 1810, with thousands of nutmeg plants were transplanted to various British colonies, ending the two centuries of Dutch spice monopoly. In the 1816 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, upon British Conquest of Java in 1811, the Dutch regained control of the East Indies, with a second treaty in 1824 exchanged Dutch control of Malacca with the British colony of Bengkoeloe. Further extractive policies, treaties, and conflicts towards the local rulers in the Indies brought the archipelago under control, with Atjeh was subdued in 1912, and the Bird's Head Peninsula was finally controlled by the Dutch in 1920.\n \nAttempts to bring reform in the colony was made, especially after the reveal by Multatuli of the infamous Cultuurstelsel (Cultivation Policy) of sugar, coffee, tea, and indigo, which was implemented after the costly Belgian War of Independence and The Eighth Java War almost bring the Kingdom of the Netherlands into bankruptcy. Liberal politicians such as Theodor van Deventer and Snouck Hurgronje advises cooperation with the Bumiputras, which finally was realized in 1901 by Queen Wilhelmina as The Dutch Ethical Policies. The policies of education, agriculture, and transmigration brought immense advancement of the Bumiputra society in Java and Sumatra, as the two are the most profitable territories of the colony. Bumiputra organizations, such as Boedi Oetomo (established in 1908), Sarekat Islam (est. 1911), Indische Partij (est. 1913) and the Indies Social-Democratic Association (est. 1914) was the prime examples of the liberal attempts to encourage Bumiputra participation on both political and economic fronts. Upon the end of the Great War, an advisory council was instituted in 1918, known as the Volksraad.\n \nBut after the failed Indonesian Communist Uprising in 1927 and the Great Depression of 1929, the Ethical Policies was suspended as a result of austerity policies, and prominent Indonesian nationalists such as Soekarno, Hatta, and Sjahrir were exiled on the Great East. Other than that, the Dutch conservatives managed to get the upper hand in the Volskraad, further slowing the reform in the name of preserving 'Rust en Orde (Peace and Order)'. But despite of that, the political situation was still a bit fragile. A catastrophe, in one way or another, can brought the archipelago into disorder once more."

 holhis_history.5.d:0 "The East Indies economy is largely supported by extractive and agricultural sectors, with coal and oil mines were spread across the archipelago, and so is sugarcane, rice fields, tea, coffee, indigo, maize, and rubber plantations. Other than clothing and food, the Indies were depended on finer consumer goods from the Dutch Mainland, and also supply of guns, ships, and troops to maintain control of the archipelago.\n\nDespite of that, the East Indies still produces a few of her own weaponary in Artilerieinrichtingen Bandoeng in Western Java. In addition of that, the Soerabaja Drydock in East Java was serving the principal naval base of the Indies.\n \nA few iron deposits was discovered in the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi, and oil fields, both offshore and overland were planned to be exploited upon the end of the Malaise, and can be used should the need arise. Overall, the archipelago is in dire need of industrialization if the Dutch East Indies wants to be more self-sufficient."

 holhis_history.6.t:0 "Political Division the Dutch East Indies"
 holhis_history.6.d:0 "By 1936, the Dutch East Indies was comprised of three major regions: Sumatra, Java, and Borneo en de Grote Oost.\n \nSumatra region was comprised of ten residencies, and for the sake of simplicity is represented into three in-map states of Atjeh (the last territory conquered on the island, in 1915), Northern Sumatra, and Southern Sumatra.\n \nJava was comprised of three provinces, but with acknowledging the importance of Batavia while in turn downplayed the importance of Mataram Vorstenlanden, the island of Java is divided in-map into states of Batavia, Western Java, and East Java.\n \nBorneo and the Great East was ruled from Makassar in Southern Sulawesi, and comprised of the residencies and afdeelings in the Lesser Sunda Islands, the Dutch part of Borneo Island, the Island of Sulawesi (Celebes), Moluccas, and Dutch New Guineaa (Papua). Accordingly, these were grouped and represented in-map with Dutch Borneo divided into two longitudinal halves, Sulawesi into two latitudinal halves, Papua into two latitudinal halves, and West Timor as its own state.\n \nAll these new states is the cleanest way to represent the historical division of Dutch East Indies without making it too complicated, such as editing provinces and else."
